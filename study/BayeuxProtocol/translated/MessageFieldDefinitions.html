<h1 class="clause">3. Message Field Definitions</h1>

<h2 class="clause">3.1. channel</h2>

<p>
    The channel message field MUST be included in every Bayeux message to specify
    the source or destination of the message. In a request, the channel specifies
    the destination of the message, and in a response it specifies the source of
    the message.
</p>

<h2 class="clause">3.2. version</h2>

<p>
    The version message field MUST be included in messages to/from the
    "/meta/handshake" channel to indicate the protocol version expected by the
    client/server.
</p>

<h2 class="clause">3.3. minimumVersion</h2>

<p>
    The minimumVersion message field MAY be included in messages to/from the
    "/meta/handshake" channel to indicate the oldest protocol version that can be
    handled by the client/server.
</p>

<h2 class="clause">3.4. supportedConnectionTypes</h2>

<p>
    The supportedConnectionTypes field is included in messages to/from the
    "/meta/handshake" channel to allow clients and servers to reveal the transports
    that are supported. The value is an array of strings, with each string
    representing a transport name. Defined connection types include:
</p>
<dl>
    <dt>long-polling</dt>
    <dd>
        This transport is defined in section 6.1.
    </dd>
    <dt>callback-polling</dt>
    <dd>
        This transport is defined in section 6.2.
    </dd>
    <dt>iframe</dt>
    <dd>
        OPTIONAL transport using the document content of a hidden iframe element.
    </dd>
    <dt>flash</dt>
    <dd>
        OPTIONAL transport using the capabilities of a browser flash plugin.
    </dd>
</dl>

<p>
    All server and client implementations MUST support the "long-polling"
    connection type and SHOULD support "callback-polling".<br/>
    All other connection types are OPTIONAL.
</p>

<h2 class="clause">3.5. clientId</h2>

<p>
    The clientId message field uniquely identifies a client to the Bayeux server.
    The clientId message field MUST be included in every message sent to the server
    except for messages sent to the "/meta/handshake" channel and MAY be omitted in
    a publish message (see section 5.1).<br/>
    The clientId field MUST be returned in every message response except for a
    failed handshake request and for a publish message response that was send without
    clientId.
</p>

<h2 class="clause">3.6. advice</h2>

<p>
    The advice field provides a way for servers to inform clients of their
    preferred mode of client operation so that in conjunction with server-enforced
    limits, Bayeux implementations can prevent resource exhaustion and inelegant
    failure modes.
</p>

<p>
    The advice field is a JSON encoded object containing general and transport specific values
    that indicate modes of operation, timeouts and other potential transport
    specific parameters. Fields may occur either in the top level of a message or
    within a transport specific section.
</p>

<p>
    Unless otherwise specified in sections 5 and 6, any Bayeux response message may
    contain an advice field. Advice received always superceeds any previous
    received advice.
</p>

<p>
    An example advice field is:
</p>
<pre class="example">
     "advice": {
        "reconnect": "retry",
        "interval": 1000,
        "callback-polling": {
            "reconnect": "handshake"
         }
     }
</pre>
<!-- FIXME: need more advice examples here! -->

<h3 class="clause">3.6.1. reconnect advice</h3>

<p>
    The reconnect advice field is a string that indicates how the client should
    act in the case of a failure to connect. Defined reconnect values are:
</p>
<dl>
    <dt>retry</dt>
    <dd>
        a client MAY attempt to reconnect with a /meta/connect after the interval (as defined by "interval"
        advice or client-default backoff), and with the same credentials.
    </dd>
    <dt>handshake</dt>
    <dd>
        the server has terminated any prior connection status and the client MUST
        reconnect with a /meta/handshake message.<br/>
        A client MUST NOT automatically retry if handshake reconnect has been received.
    </dd>
    <dt>none</dt>
    <dd>
        hard failure for the connect attempt. Do not attempt to reconnect at all.<br/>
        A client MUST respect reconnect advice of none and MUST NOT automatically
        retry or handshake.
    </dd>
</dl>

<p>
    Any client that does not implement all defined values of reconnect MUST NOT
    automatically retry or handshake.
</p>

<h3 class="clause">3.6.2. interval advice</h3>

<p>
    An integer representing the minimum period in milliseconds for a client to delay
    subsequent requests to the /meta/connect channel.<br/>
    A negative period indicates that the message should not be retried.
</p>

<p>
    A client MUST implement interval support, but a client MAY exceed the interval
    provided by the server. A client SHOULD implement a backoff strategy to
    increase the interval if requests to the server fail without new advice being
    received from the server.
</p>

<h3 class="clause">3.6.3. multiple-clients advice</h3>

<p>
    This is a boolean field, which if true indicates that the server has detected
    multiple Bayeux client instances running within the same HTTP client.
</p>

<h3 class="clause">3.6.4. hosts advice</h3>

<p>
    This is an array of strings field, which if present indicates a list of host
    names or IP addresses that MAY be used as alternate servers with which the
    client may connect. If a client receives advice to re-handshake and the
    current server is not included in a supplied hosts list, then the client SHOULD
    try the hosts in order until a successful connection is establish. Advice
    received during handshakes with hosts in the list supercedes any previously
    received advice.
</p>

<h2 class="clause">3.7. connectionType</h2>

<p>
    The connectionType message field specifies the type of transport the client
    requires for communication. The connectionType message field MUST be included
    in request messages to the "/meta/connect" channel. Connection types are
    defined in section 4.7.
</p>

<h2 class="clause">3.8. id</h2>

<p>
    An id field MAY be included in any Bayeux message with an alpha numeric value:
</p>
<pre class="example">
id   =   alphanum *( alphanum )
</pre>
<p>
    Generation of IDs is implementation specific and may be provided by the
    application. Messages published to /meta/** and /service/** SHOULD have id
    fields that are unique within the the connection.
</p>

<p>
    Messages sent in response to messages delivered to /meta/** channels MUST use
    the same message id as the request message.
</p>

<p>
    Messages sent in response to messages delivered to /service/** channels SHOULD
    use the same message id as the request message or an id derived from the
    request message id.
</p>

<h2 class="clause">3.9. timestamp</h2>

<p>
    The timestamp message field SHOULD be specified in the following ISO 8601
    profile (all times SHOULD be sent in GMT time):
</p>
<pre class="example">
   YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.ss
</pre>
<p>A timestamp message field is OPTIONAL in all Bayeux messages.</p>

<h2 class="clause">3.10. data</h2>

<p>
    The data message field is an arbitrary JSON encoded object that contains event
    information. The data field MUST be included in publish messages, and a Bayeux
    server MUST include the data field in an event delivery message.
</p>

<h2 class="clause">3.11. connectionId</h2>

<p>
    The connectionId field was used during development of the Bayeux protocol
    and its use is now deprecated.
</p>

<h2 class="clause">3.12. successful</h2>

<p>
    The successful boolean message field is used to indicate success or failure and
    MUST be included in responses to the "/meta/handshake", "/meta/connect",
    "/meta/subscribe","/meta/unsubscribe", "/meta/disconnect", and publish
    channels.
</p>

<h2 class="clause">3.13. subscription</h2>

<p>
    The subscription message field specifies the channels the client wishes to
    subscribe to or unsubscribe from. The subscription message field MUST be
    included in requests and responses to/from the "/meta/subscribe" or
    "/meta/unsubscribe" channels.
</p>

<h2 class="clause">3.14. error</h2>

<p>
    The error message field is OPTIONAL in any Bayeux response.<br/>
    The error message field MAY indicate the type of error that occurred when a
    request returns with a false successful message. The error message field should
    be sent as a string in the following format:
</p>
<pre class="example">
error            = error_code ":" error_args ":" error_message
                 | error_code ":" ":" error_message
error_code       = digit digit digit
error_args       = string *( "," string )
error_message    = string
</pre>
<p>
    Example error strings are:
</p>
<pre>
401::No client ID
402:xj3sjdsjdsjad:Unknown Client ID
403:xj3sjdsjdsjad,/foo/bar:Subscription denied
404:/foo/bar:Unknown Channel
</pre>

<h2 class="clause">3.15. ext</h2>

<p>
    An ext field MAY be included in any Bayeux message. Its value SHOULD be a
    JSON encoded object with top level names distinguished by implementation names (eg.
    "org.dojo.Bayeux.field").
</p>

<p>
    The contents of ext may be arbitrary values that allow extensions to be
    negotiated and implemented between server and client implementations.
</p>

<h2 class="clause">3.16. json-comment-filtered</h2>
<p>
    The json-comment-filtered ext field of the handshake message is deprecated.
</p>
