<h1 class="clause">2. Protocol values</h1>

<h2 class="clause">2.1. Common Elements</h2>

<p>
    The characters used for Bayeux names and identifiers are defined by the BNF definitions:
</p>
<pre class="example">
alpha    = lowalpha | upalpha

lowalpha = "a" | "b" | "c" | "d" | "e" | "f" | "g" | "h" | "i" |
           "j" | "k" | "l" | "m" | "n" | "o" | "p" | "q" | "r" |
           "s" | "t" | "u" | "v" | "w" | "x" | "y" | "z"

upalpha  = "A" | "B" | "C" | "D" | "E" | "F" | "G" | "H" | "I" |
           "J" | "K" | "L" | "M" | "N" | "O" | "P" | "Q" | "R" |
           "S" | "T" | "U" | "V" | "W" | "X" | "Y" | "Z"

digit    = "0" | "1" | "2" | "3" | "4" | "5" | "6" | "7" | "8" | "9"

alphanum = alpha | digit

mark     = "-" | "_" | "!" | "~" | "(" | ")" | "$" | "@"

string   = *( alphanum | mark | " " | "/" | "*" | "." )

token    = ( alphanum | mark ) *( alphanum | mark )

integer  = digit *( digit )
</pre>

<h2 class="clause">2.2. Channels</h2>

<p>
    Channels are identified by names that are styled as the absolute path component of
    a URI without parameters as defined by RFC2396.
</p>
<pre class="example">
channel_name     = "/"  channel_segments
channel_segments = channel_segment *( "/" channel_segment )
channel_segment  = token
</pre>
<p>
    The channel name consists of an initial "/" followed by an optional sequence of
    path segments separated by a single slash "/" character. Within a path segment,
    the character "/" is reserved.
</p>

<p>
    Channel names commencing with "/meta/" are reserved for the Bayeux protocol.<br/>
    Example non-meta channel names are:
</p>
<dl>
    <dt>/foo</dt>
    <dt>/foo/bar</dt>
    <dt>/foo-bar/(foobar)</dt>
</dl>

<h3 class="clause">2.2.1 Channel Globbing</h3>

<p>
    A set of channels may be specified with a channel globbing pattern:
</p>
<pre class="example">
channel_pattern  = *( "/" channel_segment ) "/" wild_card
wild_card = "*" | "**"
</pre>

<p>
    The channel patterns support only trailing wildcards of either "*" to match a
    single segment or "**" to match multiple segments. Example channel patterns are:
</p>
<dl>
    <dt>/foo/*</dt>
    <dd>
        Matches /foo/bar and /foo/boo. Does not match /foo, /foobar or /foo/bar/boo.
    </dd>
    <dt>/foo/**</dt>
    <dd>
        Matches /foo/bar, /foo/boo and /foo/bar/boo. Does not match /foo, /foobar
        or /foobar/boo
    </dd>
</dl>
