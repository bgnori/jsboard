<p>
    Bayeux is a protocol for transporting asynchronous messages (primarily over HTTP),
    with low latency between a web server and web clients.
</p>

<h1 class="contents">Table of Contents</h1>

<div id="toc"></div>

<h1 class="clause">1. Introduction</h1>

<h2 class="clause">1.1. Purpose</h2>

<p>
    The primary purpose of Bayeux is to support responsive bidirectional interactions between
    web clients, for example using using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AJAX">AJAX</a>, and the web server.
</p>

<p>
    Bayeux is a protocol for transporting asynchronous messages (primarily over HTTP), with low latency between a web
    server and a web client.
    The messages are routed via named channels and can be delivered:
</p>
<ul>
<li>server to client</li>
<li>client to server</li>
<li>client to client (via the server)</li>
</ul>
<p>
    By default, publish subscribe routing semantics are applied to the channels.
</p>

<p>
    Delivery of asynchronous messages from the server to a web client is often described as <em>server-push</em>.<br/>
    The combination of server push techniques with an Ajax web application has been called <em>Comet</em>.<br/>
    CometD is a project by the Dojo Foundation to provide multiple implementation of the Bayeux protocol
    in several programming languages.
</p>

<p>
    Bayeux seeks to reduce the complexity of developing Comet web applications
    by allowing implementors to more easily interoperate, to solve common message
    distribution and routing problems, and to provide mechanisms for incremental
    improvements and extensions.
</p>

<h2 class="clause">1.2. Requirements</h2>

<p>
    The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
    "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
    interpreted as described in RFC2119. An implementation is not compliant if it
    fails to satisfy one or more of the MUST or REQUIRED level requirements for the
    protocols it implements. An implementation that satisfies all the MUST or
    REQUIRED level and all the SHOULD level requirements for its protocols is said
    to be "unconditionally compliant"; one that satisfies all the MUST level
    requirements but not all the SHOULD level requirements for its protocols is
    said to be "conditionally compliant."
</p>

<h2 class="clause">1.3. Terminology</h2>

<p>
    This specification uses a number of terms to refer to the roles played by
    participants in, and objects of, Bayeux communication:
</p>
<dl>
    <dt>client</dt>
    <dd>
        A program that initiates the communication.<br/>
        A HTTP client is a client that initiates TCP/IP connections for the purpose of sending HTTP requests.<br/>
        A Bayeux client initiates the Bayeux message exchange and will typically
        execute within a HTTP client, but it is likely to have Bayeux clients that
        execute within HTTP servers. Implementations may distinguish between
        Bayeux clients running within a HTTP client and Bayeux clients running
        within the HTTP server. Specifically server-side Bayeux clients MAY be
        privileged clients with access to private information about other clients
        (e.g. client IDs) and subscriptions.
        <!--
        COMMENT:
        Consider explicitly defining the terms "remote client" and "local/server-side client".
        By saying implementations are allowed to distinguish between them, the spec is implicitly
        ack'ing the distinction anyway.  More on this later re: the handling of meta channels.
        -->
    </dd>
    <dt>server</dt>
    <dd>
        An application program that accepts communications from clients.<br/>
        A HTTP server accepts TCP/IP connections in order to service HTTP requests by
        sending back HTTP responses.<br/>
        A Bayeux server accepts and responds to the message exchanges initiated by a Bayeux client.
    </dd>
    <dt>request</dt>
    <dd>
        An HTTP request message as defined by section 5 of RFC 2616.
    </dd>
    <dt>response</dt>
    <dd>
        A HTTP response message as defined by section 6 of RFC 2616.
    </dd>
    <dt>message</dt>
    <dd>
        A message is a JSON encoded object exchanged between client and server for the
        purpose of implementing the Bayeux protocol as defined by sections 3, 4 and 5.
    </dd>
    <dt>event</dt>
    <dd>
        Application specific data that is sent over the Bayeux protocol
    </dd>
    <dt>envelope</dt>
    <dd>
        The transport specific message format that wraps a standard Bayeux message.
    </dd>
    <dt>channel</dt>
    <dd>
        A named destination and/or source of events.<br/>
        Events are published to channels and subscribers to channels receive the published events.
    </dd>
    <dt>connection</dt>
    <dd>
        A communication link that is established either permanently
        or transiently, for the purposes of messages exchange.<br/>
        A client is connected if a link is established with the server,
        over which asynchronous events can be received.
    </dd>
    <dt>JSON</dt>
    <dd>
        JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is a lightweight data-interchange format.<br/>
        It is easy for humans to read and write. It is easy for machines to parse
        and generate. It is based on a subset of the JavaScript Programming
        Language, Standard ECMA-262 3rd Edition - December 1999.<br/>
        JSON is described at <a href="http://www.json.org/">http://www.json.org/</a>.

<h2 class="clause">1.4. Overall Operation</h2>

<h3 class="clause">1.4.1. HTTP Transport</h3>

<p>
    The HTTP protocol is a request/response protocol. A client sends a request to
    the server in the form of a request method, URI, and protocol version, followed
    by a MIME-like message containing request modifiers, client information, and
    optional body content over a connection with a server. The server responds with
    a status line, including the message's protocol version and a success or error
    code, followed by a MIME-like message containing server information, entity
    metainformation, and possible entity-body content.
</p>

<p>
    The server may not initiate a connection with a client nor send an unrequested
    response to the client, thus asynchronous events cannot be delivered from
    server to client unless a previously issued request exists. In order to allow
    two way asynchronous communication, Bayeux supports the use of multiple HTTP
    connections between a client and server, so that previously issued requests are
    available to transport server to client messages.
</p>

<p>
    The recommendation of section 8.1.4 of RFC 2616 is that a single client
    SHOULD NOT maintain more than 2 connection with any server, thus the Bayeux
    protocol MUST NOT require any more than 2 HTTP requests to be simultaneously
    handled by a server in order to handle all application (Bayeux based or
    otherwise) requests from a client.
</p>

<h3 class="clause">1.4.2. Non HTTP Transports</h3>
<!--
	FIXME: we are currently silent on some important points:
		1.) must conforming servers which don't use HTTP *also* support one or
		more of the HTTP-based mechanisms?
		2.) must conforming servers that aren't HTTP-based support plain-text
		payloads?
-->
<p>
    While HTTP is the predominant transport protocol used on the internet, it is
    not intended that it will be the only transport for Bayeux. Other transports
    that support a request/response paradigm may be used. However this document
    assumes HTTP for reasons of clarity. When non-HTTP connection-level
    transport mechanisms are employed, conforming Bayeux servers and clients MUST
    still conform to the semantics of the JSON encoded messages outlined in this document.
</p>

<p>
    Several of the "transport types" described in this document are distinguished
    primarily by how they wrap messages for delivery over HTTP and the sequence
    and content of the HTTP connections initiated by clients. While this may seem
    like a set of implementation concerns to observant readers, the difficulties of
    creating interoperable implementations without specifying these semantics fully
    is a primary motivation for the development of this specification.<br/>
    Were the deployed universe of servers and clients more flexible, it may not
    have been necessary to develop Bayeux.
</p>

<p>
    Regardless, care has been taken in the development of this specification to
    ensure that future clients and servers which implement differing
    connection-level strategies and encodings may still evolve and continue to be
    conforming Bayeux implementations so long as they implement the JSON-based
    public/subscribe semantics outlined herein.
</p>

<p class="note">
    The rest of this document speaks as though HTTP will be used for message transport.
</p>

<h3 class="clause">1.4.3. Javascript</h3>

<p>
    Bayeux clients implemented in JavaScript that run within the security
    framework of a browser MUST adhere to the restrictions imposed
    by the browser, such as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same_origin_policy">same origin policy</a>
    or the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/access-control/">CORS</a> specification,
    or the threading model.<br/>
    These restrictions are normally enforced by the browser itself, but nonetheless
    the client implementation must be aware of these restrictions and adhere to them.
</p>
<p>
    Bayeux clients implemented in JavaScript but not running within a browser MAY
    relax the restrictions imposed by browsers.
</p>

<h3 class="clause">1.4.4. Client to Server event delivery</h3>

<p>
    A Bayeux event is sent from the client to the server via a HTTP request
    initiated by a client and transmitted to the origin server via a chain of
    zero or more intermediaries (proxy, gateway or tunnel):
</p>
<pre class="example">
BC ---------- U ---------- P ------------ O ---------- BS
 | --M0(E)--&gt; |            |              |            |
 |            | ---HTTP request(M0(E))--&gt; |            |
 |            |            |              | --M0(E)--&gt; |
 |            |            |              | &lt;---M1---- |
 |            | &lt;---HTTP response(M1)---- |            |
 | &lt;---M1---  |            |              |            |
 |            |            |              |            |
</pre>
<p>
    The figure above represents a Bayeux event E encapsulated in a Bayeux message M0
    being sent from a Bayeux client BC to a Bayeux server BS via a HTTP request
    transmitted from a User Agent U to to an Origin server O via a proxy P. The
    HTTP response contains another Bayeux message M1 that will at least contain the
    protocol response to M0, but may contain other Bayeux events initiated on the
    server or on other clients.
</p>

<h3 class="clause">1.4.5. Server to Client event delivery </h3>

<p>
    A Bayeux event is sent from the server to the client via a HTTP response to
    a HTTP request sent in anticipation by a client and transmitted to an
    origin server via a chain of zero or more intermediaries (proxy, gateway or
    tunnel):
</p>
<pre class="example">
BC ---------- U ---------- P ------------ O ---------- BS
 | ---M0---&gt;  |            |              |            |
 |            | --- HTTP request(M0) ---&gt; |            |
 |            |            |              | ----M0---&gt; |
 ~            ~            ~              ~            ~ wait
 |            |            |              | &lt;--M1(E)-- |
 |            | &lt;--HTTP response(M1(E))-- |            |
 | &lt;--M1(E)-- |            |              |            |
 ~            ~            ~              ~            ~
</pre>

<p>
    The figure above represents a Bayeux message M0 being sent from a Bayeux client
    BC to a Bayeux server BS via a HTTP request transmitted from a User Agent U to
    to an Origin server O via a proxy P. The message M0 is sent in anticipation of
    a Bayeux event to be delivered from server to client and the Bayeux server
    waits for such an event before sending a response. A Bayeux event E is shown
    being delivered via Bayeux message M1 in the HTTP response. M1 may contain
    zero, one or more Bayeux events destined for the Bayeux client.
</p>

<p>
    The transprt used to send events from the server to the client may terminate
    the HTTP response (which does not imply that the connection is closed) after
    delivery of M1 or use techniques to leave the HTTP response uncompleted and
    stream additional messages to the client.
</p>

<h4 class="clause">1.4.5.i Polling transports</h4>

<p>
    Polling transports will always terminate the HTTP response after sending all
    available Bayeux messages.
</p>
<pre class="example">
BC ---------- U ---------- P ------------ O ---------- BS
 | ---M0---&gt;  |            |              |            |
 |            | --- HTTP request(M0) ---&gt; |            |
 |            |            |              | ----M0---&gt; |
 ~            ~            ~              ~            ~ wait
 |            |            |              | &lt;--M1(E)-- |
 |            | &lt;--HTTP response(M1(E))-- |            |
 | &lt;--M1(E)-- |            |              |            |
 | ---M2---&gt;  |            |              |            |
 |            | --- HTTP request(M2) ---&gt; |            |
 |            |            |              | ----M2---&gt; |
 ~            ~            ~              ~            ~ wait
</pre>
<p>
    On receipt of the HTTP response containing M1, the Bayeux client issues a new
    Bayeux message M2 either immediately or after an interval in anticipation of
    more events to be delivered from server to client.<br/>
    Bayeux implementations MUST support a specific style of polling
    transport called <em>long polling</em> (see sec 6.1).
</p>

<h4 class="clause">1.4.5.ii Streaming transports</h4>

<p>
    Some Bayeux transports use the <em>streaming technique</em> (also called the
    <em>forever response</em>) that allows multiple messages to be sent within the
    same HTTP response:
</p>
<pre class="example">
BC ---------- U ---------- P ------------ O ---------- BS
 | ---M0---&gt;  |            |              |            |
 |            | --- HTTP request(M0) ---&gt; |            |
 |            |            |              | ----M0---&gt; |
 ~            ~            ~              ~            ~ wait
 |            |            |              | &lt;--M1(E0)- |
 |            | &lt;--HTTP response(M1(E0))- |            |
 | &lt;--M1(E0)- |            |              |            |
 ~            ~            ~              ~            ~ wait
 |            |            |              | &lt;--M1(E1)- |
 |            | &lt;----(M1(E1))------------ |            |
 | &lt;--M1(E1)- |            |              |            |
 ~            ~            ~              ~            ~ wait
</pre>
<p>
    Streaming techniques avoid the latency and extra messaging of anticipatory
    requests, but are subject to the implementation of user agents and proxies as they
    requires incomplete HTTP responses to be delivered to the Bayeux client.
</p>

<h3 class="clause">1.4.6. Two connection operation</h3>

<p>
    In order to achieve bidirectional communication, a Bayeux client uses 2
    HTTP connections (see section 1.4.1) to a Bayeux server so that both server to client and
    client to server messaging may occur asynchronously:
</p>
<pre class="example">
BC ---------- U ---------- P ------------ O ---------- BS
 | ---M0---&gt;  |            |              |            |
 |            | ------ req0(M0) --------&gt; |            |
 |            |            |              | ----M0---&gt; |
 ~            ~            ~              ~            ~ wait
 | --M1(E1)-&gt; |            |              |            |
 |            | ----- req1(M1(E1))------&gt; |            |
 |            |            |              | --M1(E1)-&gt; |
 |            |            |              | &lt;---M2---- |
 |            | &lt;---- resp1(M2)---------- |            |
 | &lt;---M2---  |            |              |            |
 ~            ~            ~              ~            ~ wait
 |            |            |              | &lt;-M3(E2)-- |
 |            | &lt;-----resp2(M3(E2))------ |            |
 | &lt;-M3(E2)-- |            |              |            |
 | ---M4---&gt;  |            |              |            |
 |            | ------req3(M4)----------&gt; |            |
 |            |            |              | ----M4---&gt; |
 ~            ~            ~              ~            ~ wait
</pre>
<p>
    HTTP requests req0 and req1 are sent on different TCP/IP connections, so that
    the response to req1 may be sent before the response to req0. Implementations
    MUST control HTTP pipelining so that req1 does not get queued behind req0 and
    thus enforce an ordering of responses.
</p>

<h3 class="clause">1.4.7. Connection Negotiation</h3>

<p>
    Bayeux connections are negotiated between client and server with handshake
    messages that allow the connection type, authentication and other parameters to
    be agreed upon between the client and the server.
</p>
<pre class="example">
BC ----------------------------------------- BS
 | ------------------ handshake request ---&gt; |
 | &lt;---- handshake response ---------------- |
 | -------------------- connect request ---&gt; |
 ~                                           ~ wait
 | &lt;------ connect response ---------------- |
 </pre>
<p>
    Connection negotiation may be iterative and several handshake messages may be
    exchanged before a successful connection is obtained. Servers may also request
    connection renegotiation by sending an unsuccessful connect response with
    advice to reconnect with a handshake message.
</p>
<pre class="example">
BC ----------------------------------------- BS
 | ------------------ handshake request ---&gt; |
 | &lt;-- unsuccessful handshake response ----- |
 | ------------------ handshake request ---&gt; |
 | &lt;-- successful handshake response ------- |
 | -------------------- connect request ---&gt; |
 ~                                           ~ wait
 | &lt;------ connect response ---------------- |
 | -------------------- connect request ---&gt; |
 | &lt;---- unsucessful connect response ------ |
 | ------------------ handshake request ---&gt; |
 | &lt;-- successful handshake response ------- |
 | -------------------- connect request ---&gt; |
 ~                                           ~ wait
 | &lt;------ connect response ---------------- |
 </pre>


<h3 class="clause">1.4.8. Unconnected operation</h3>

<p>
    OPTIONALLY, messages can be sent without a prior handshake (see 5.1 Publish event messages).
</p>
<pre class="example">
BC ----------------------------------------- BS
 | ------------------- message request ----&gt; |
 | &lt;---- message response ------------------ |
</pre>
<p>
    This pattern is often useful when implementing non-browser clients for Bayeux
    servers. These clients often simply wish to address messages to other clients
    which the Bayeux server may be servicing, but do not wish to listen for events
    themselves.
</p>

<h2 class="clause">1.5 State Tables</h2>

<h3 class="clause">1.5.1 Client State</h3>
<pre class="example">
   -------------++------------+-------------+------------+------------
   State/Event  || handshake  | Timeout     | Successful | Disconnect
                ||  request   |             |   connect  |  request
                ||   sent     |             |  response  |   sent
